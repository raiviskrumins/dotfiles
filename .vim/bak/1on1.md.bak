# Good
Improving the morning meeting by using dev standups


# Not so good
Sprint planning
    Seems to take way too much time.
    Most of time spent is between 1, maybe 2, people. No one else is
        really involved.
    Maybe too much detail- have a shorter breakout later with those involved.
Pivotal Tracker doesnt seem to fit API flow, nor our general process.
Dev enviroments for others. Seems like others struggled with API.
