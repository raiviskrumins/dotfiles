Good
====
* Pair programming with Chris
    After trying it once, "for real", the benefits seem to be
    increased productivity, less time spent code reviewing, able to
    catch and address potential problems before they evolved. But it costed
    some productivity in other stories.

* Like the focus on Sprint "deliverables"


Not So Good
===========
* Do not like *everything* about the new process.
    API planning on Mondays went from 30min to a full day. :(
    Also, I feel like smaller tasks might end up going under the radar,
    when they ought to be addressed.
