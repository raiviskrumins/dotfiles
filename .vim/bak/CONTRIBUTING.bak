### 1. Naming Conventions
**Creating Pointers vs Making Instances**
When creating and returning a pointer object, the method/function's name
should begin with `New`, versus instantiation methods which need to begin 
with `Make`.

For example:

    func NewThing() *Thing {
        return new(Thing)    
    }

    func MakeThing() Thing {
        return Thing{}    
    }
